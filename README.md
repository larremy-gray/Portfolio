# Welcome!
## What is this?
The point of this repository is share sample work. I suppose that I am trying to pivot my career, and I am using this as a way to add substance to my resume/LinkedIn profile. As of December 29th, 2021, I only have two projects:
### ames_housing_brainstation_final
This folder contains a Python Jupyter notebook and supporting documents for the final project of a data science course that I took at Brainstation. This should demonstrate basic data science skills and familiarity and experience with the standard Python data science libraries.
### rude_bmi
This is a bmi calculator with the option to add socialy unacceptable comments. I demonstrate some OOP in the form of subclassing, use of the Tkinter library, and some some other Python skills like flow control, exception handling, functions, etc.

I have used Windows 10/11 and Python 3.9 in the development of these items.
